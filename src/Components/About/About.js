          &nbsp;Mingyu Kil is an amateur photographer based in Korea.<br></br>

          He takes something gonna be never meet again once passed by.<br></br>
          Redeveloping cities, people around him, and cultural heritage like the Korean palace.<br />
          The cities are re-builded to enrich lives for mankind.
          And heritages are also repaired and restored to pass on.<br />
          <br></br>

          &nbsp;The buildings located in the cities on destroyed and re-born also
          give us a beautiful landscape, skylines and so forth.<br />

          However it also only shows us the appearance of the past in passing time.<br />

          He worked to take the photos of the scenes which went passing by the time
          from his own point of view as possible as beautiful.<br />
          <br />

          &nbsp;And also, while living in Pusan and Masan, He took photos of these cities' seas.<br />

          I tried to capture the paradoxical charm of the sea with strength
          and softness to the best of my ability.<br />

          <br />
          &nbsp;he hasn't done any work that has been commissioned by the client yet,
          but he is willing to do it.<br />
          It's not the perfect picture, but he will show you how it develops day by day.<br />
